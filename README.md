- 👋 Hi, we are @utahcarol. I'm an alt. country band with a few albums floating around the ethers. There are two of us in the band.
- 👀 We are interested in collaborating, learning, listening, sharing, changing our narratives and being of service.
- 🌱 We are currently writing new songs, and also learning how to create quality content for inclusive communities. We are also here to learn how to include our own on Web 2 and Web 3 platforms.
- 💞️ We are looking to collaborate on many projects. Creative, music, art, writing, film, photography, speaking, reading, digital, social.
- 📫 We can be reached on twitter/ig/fb/YT @utahcarol or discord at snaps#3760. Or, try @birkcreative on same.
- 💞️ Our mantra is learn by doing and then share everything we know with others. This is the way.
